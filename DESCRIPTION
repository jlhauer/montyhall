Description: This package creates a simulation to examine the effectiveness of different strategies in the Monty Hall game show, where a contestant tries to select a winning door with a car behind it and avoid selecting the loser doors with a goat behind it. The strategy in the game is whether a contestant should stay or switch after the host reveals one of the losing doors.
